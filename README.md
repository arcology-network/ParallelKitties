# Parallellized CryptoKitties

## 1. Introduction

Parallel-Kitties is the parallelized version of the original CryptoKitties core developed by Dapper Labs (https://www.dapperlabs.com) using the concurrency framework.
The original CryptoKitties could be downloaded from https://github.com/dapperlabs/cryptokitties-bounty.

The main goal of ParallelKitties is to demonstrate how a typical, real-world application written in Solidity with our concurrency control may achieve dramatic performance gains.
As of today, the PK only works on our network.
